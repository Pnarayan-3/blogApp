<h1 class="head">About</h1>
<p>Welcome to my blog application â€” a project developed as part of my B.Tech 6th semester minor project.
    This platform is designed to provide a simple, clean, and user-friendly space for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
</p>
<h2> Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    This blog app was built to demonstrate full-stack web development skills and features:
    <ol><li> Frontend: Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for a responsive and dynamic user interface.</li>
    <li> Backend: Built with Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and API routes.</li>
    <li>Database: Integrated with MongoDB to store user data and blog content securely.</li>
    <li> Authentication: Includes user login and registration functionality for secure access and personalized content management.</li>
    <li> CRUD Functionality: Users can create, edit, delete, and read blog posts efficiently.</li></ol>
</p>
<h2> Purpose</h2>
<p>The main goal of this project is to explore the structure and implementation of a real-world web application
     while focusing on clean code, usability, and responsive design. It also helped me understand the interaction
      between frontend and backend systems, and how to deploy a complete app.</p>
